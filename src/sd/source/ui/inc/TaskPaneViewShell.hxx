    - It fits better into the concept of panes being docking windows whose
    content, a view shell, can be exchanged on runtime.
    - A control in the tool panel that wants to show a context menu has to
    do that over the dispatcher of a shell.  These shells, usually
    implemented by the controls themselves, have to be managed by someone.
    If interpreted as object bars this can be handled by the
