Layout engine for OpenOffice.org  -  Work in Progress

Simple dialogs have been ported now: zoom and wordcount.

New code lives in "layoutdialogs" CWS or ooo-build trunk.

* Checkout layoutdialogs cws.

* Configure using --enable-layout.

* [d]make all

* [d]make install DESTDIR=$(pwd)/ooo-layout/

Integration into OOo:

* After instaling, run

  cd ooo-cvs/program
  ./soffice.bin

  Start a [Writer] document and choose View/Zoom or Extra/Word count.

* Also See workben/layout/README.
