/** creates a factory which can be used when implementing old-style singletons

    Before UNO having the component context concept, singletons were implemented by providing
    a factory which return the very same component instance for every creation request.

    Nowadays, singletons are implemented by making them available at the component context,
    as dedicated property.

    To bridge between both worlds - sometimes necessary to support legacy code, which instantiates
    singletons at the global service manager, instead of obtaining the property at the
    component context -, you can use the function below. I creates a single-component
    factory, which behaves like the old factories did: Upon multiple creation requests,
    it will always return the same instance. Additionally, the signature of the function
    is the same as the signature of <code>::cppu::createSingleComponentFactory</code>
    (which creates a "normal" component factory), so you can use both factory functions
    in the same context.
