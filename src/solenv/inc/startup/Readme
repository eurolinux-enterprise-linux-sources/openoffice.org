here are some hints about our use of the startup directory.

because our variable "OS" was already in use, we don't use the default 
subtrees of startup. for example "wntmsci3" uses the subtree "WNT".

the .INCLUDEDIRS line in startup.mk gives you the oportunity of switching
to your own set of central makefiles.
